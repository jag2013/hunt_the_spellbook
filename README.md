## Hunt The Spellbook

**Student:** Jason Holloway

**Udacity Hide and Seek VR Project**

**UE4 Version:** 4.15.3

**Headset:** Oculus Rift

**Locomotion Method:** This game uses the same locomotion method taught by the instructor. You press the trigger button (MotionController R Trigger) on the right rift controller. A balloon-like projectile plops out and lands where you direct it. There is an arc trace for projectile prior to launching, and when the projectile impacts the ground the player is then moved to that location. I also implemented a little rotation mechanism using the axis input of "MotionController(R) Thumbstick" so the player doesn't have to teleport just to rotate themselves.

**Player Controls of Experience:** You pick up a spellbook using the same mechanism taught earlier in the course by the instructor. You simply place the tip of the player's wand near a spellbook and pressing and holding the "MotionController(R) Grip1" button which is on the right controller. To release a spellbook from the wands grip simply release the button.

**How to Play:** Touch the start button with your wand to begin the game. Spellbooks will spawn at random locations in the room. The goal is to pick up a spellbook and return it to the bookshelf. After the spellbook is returned the spellbook will disappear, a point will be added to the score on the wall, and a new spellbook will appear.

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [Learn Unreal VR Nanodegree Foundation Program](https://www.udacity.com)

This is your first chance to build an Unreal VR experience based around locomotion. Youâ€™ll create a find-the-object style of game, create a set of blueprints that randomly hides an object, and develop a locomotion method that allows you to move around the apartment so that you can find the object.
